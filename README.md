# Code for self-targeting library analysis

This repository contains code that was used for analyzing self-targeting libraries in the manuscript [*"Effective Genome Editing with ISDra2 TnpB and Deep Learning-Predicted Ï‰RNAs"*](https://www.schwanklab.org/publications) by Marquart et al.

For code regarding the prediction tool TEEP, check out our second repository [here](https://github.com/uzh-dqbm-cmi/Tnpb).
